Models: Timesheet & TimesheetEntry:

- TotalHours in Timesheet and Hours in TimesheetEntry are both of type string. Consider using a more appropriate data type like double, decimal, or even TimeSpan.
- TimesheetEntry.Date is a string. For better operations related to date (sorting, filtering, calculations), it would be more beneficial to use DateTime.

Service Layer: TimesheetService:
- Add method: Before adding a Timesheet to the repository, it is neccesary to validate it to avoid database errors or data corruption.

Controller: TimesheetController:

In the Index POST method:
-	There's no validation of the TimesheetEntry object received from the user. Using Data Annotations in combination with ModelState.IsValid can provide a more secure way to validate user input.
-	After adding the Timesheet, all timesheets are fetched with GetAll, but the result isnâ€™t used. If you want to display them after adding, pass them to the View, otherwise remove this call.
  
Test
-	Unnecessary namespaces can be removed .
-	More scenarios need to be tested. Null parameters, Duplicate Ids, Returning the added record, multiple records are added and retrieved. 
-	Both Service and Repository needs to be tested separately as well to ensure only sanitized data is inserted to db.
-	Consider adding more tests to verify the provided timesheet was added. This can be done by replacing It.IsAny<Timesheet>() with your timesheet.

General Observations:
-	Controller should ideally not be responsible for creating domain entities (like Timesheet). Consider moving the logic that creates a Timesheet from a TimesheetEntry to a factory or the domain layer.
-	No comments or XML documentation. While the code is relatively straightforward, adding comments might be beneficial for maintainability, especially as the system grows.
-	There's no logging mechanism in place. For a production application, logging helps trace issues and monitor activities.
-	Error handling: Need to be implemented throughout. It might be a good idea to add try-catch blocks or global exception handling. Right now, any exception will lead to an unhandled error.
-	Consider introducing a ViewModel if your view requires data that is not present in the Timesheet or TimesheetEntry models. This allows for better separation between your domain entities and the data you present in the views.
